Uploadr.py
==========

Uploadr.py is a simple Python script for uploading your photos to Flickr. Unlike
many GUI applications out there, it lends itself to automation; and because it's
free and open source, you can just change it if you don't like it.


Growl Support
-------------
This version of Uploadr.py supports Growl notifications using the `Growl
python module <http://growl.info/documentation/developer/python-support.php>`_. Growl
notifications will only be sent if the python module is installed.
